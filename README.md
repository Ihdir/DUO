 # First MINOR Project - DUO

Welcome to DUO, a project that I’m incredibly proud of. This is a demonstration of my dedication, creativity, and the hard work I’ve put into learning and applying cutting-edge web technologies.

## About the Project

DUO is a dynamic and visually engaging website that showcases my skills and understanding of advanced web design techniques. The site is built with a strong emphasis on user experience and modern design principles.

## What I Learned

### Locomotive Scroll

One of the key features of DUO is the implementation of **Locomotive Scroll**, a library that enhances the scrolling experience by providing smooth, inertia-driven scrolling effects. I’ve invested significant time mastering how to integrate this library effectively to create a seamless and interactive scrolling experience.

### ScrollTrigger

Another major component of this project is **ScrollTrigger** from GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform). This tool allowed me to create complex animations that trigger based on the user’s scroll position. By learning ScrollTrigger, I was able to implement sophisticated animations that enhance the visual appeal and interactivity of the site.

### GSAP Library

**GSAP** itself has been instrumental in animating various elements on the page. From transitions to complex timeline animations, GSAP has enabled me to bring my designs to life in ways that would have been challenging with basic CSS alone.

## The Journey

As a 17-year-old aspiring developer with dreams of making it to Silicon Valley, this project represents a significant step in my journey. I’m passionate about technology and dedicated to honing my skills to achieve my goals. Working on DUO has been an exciting challenge, and I’m thrilled with the progress I’ve made.

## Features

- **Smooth Scrolling:** Powered by Locomotive Scroll for an enhanced user experience.
- **Interactive Animations:** Utilizes ScrollTrigger and GSAP for dynamic, scroll-based animations.
- **Responsive Design:** Ensures a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes.
- **User-Friendly Navigation:** Includes intuitive navigation and smooth transitions between sections.

## Future Plans

I’m continuously learning and improving my skills, with the ultimate goal of joining a leading tech hub like Silicon Valley. This project is just the beginning, and I’m excited about the future challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.

## Acknowledgments

I’d like to express my sincere gratitude to the **Sheriyan Coding School** YouTube channel. Their tutorial on creating this type of website was incredibly insightful and guided me through the process of implementing key features such as Locomotive Scroll, ScrollTrigger, and GSAP animations. 

Their detailed, step-by-step instructions and expert explanations were invaluable in bringing my project, DUO, to fruition. The knowledge gained from their tutorial not only helped me develop this project but also significantly enhanced my skills in modern web development.

A special thanks to **Sheriyan Coding School** for providing such high-quality educational content and for inspiring me to pursue my dreams of working in Silicon Valley as a young developer.

Feel free to explore the project and see what I’ve been working on. I’m always open to feedback and collaboration opportunities!
